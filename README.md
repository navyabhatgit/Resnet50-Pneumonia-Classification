Introduction

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically the ResNet50 architecture, to classify chest X-ray images as either showing signs of pneumonia or not. The ResNet50 model is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a dataset of chest X-ray images.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of chest X-ray images divided into three sets: training, validation, and test sets. Each set contains images labeled as either "Pneumonia" or "Normal".

    Training set: Used to train the model.
    Validation set: Used to tune the model hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
    Test set: Used to evaluate the final model performance.

Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries:

    Python 3.6+
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Torch
    Torchvision
    PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib torch torchvision pillow

Usage

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-classification-resnet50.git
cd pneumonia-classification-resnet50

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash

    jupyter notebook Pneumonia_Classification_Using_Resnet50.ipynb

    Run the notebook cells:
    Follow the instructions in the notebook. It covers the following steps:
        Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
        Defining the ResNet50 model.
        Training the model on the training set.
        Evaluating the model on the validation set.
        Testing the model on the test set.

Results

The final results are printed at the end of the notebook. The model achieves the following accuracy:

    Training Accuracy: 99.41%
    Validation Accuracy: 93.75%
    Test Accuracy: 75.16%
